# bpmn-multi-instance-subprocess

Runs a whole section of a process once per element, with a second iteration nested inside
it, and shows how a task says which of the active iterations it means. A delta on top of
`module-single`.

## Placeholders

Replace all of these consistently; they are the same in every blueprint.

Blueprint-specific names, each occurring in more than one place:

| `SubProcess_AssessRegion`         | the ID of the multi-instance subprocess, the constant `IterationResolver.ASSESS_REGION` and the annotations of `summariseRegion` |
| `ServiceTask_RequestPartnerOffer` | the ID of the multi-instance task inside it, and the constant `IterationResolver.REQUEST_PARTNER_OFFER`                          |
| `regionIds`, `partnerIds`         | the attributes of the workflow aggregate and the collection expressions of the two levels                                        |
| `regionId`, `partnerId`           | the element variables of the model                                                                                               |

Every multi-instance annotation names the BPMN id of an ELEMENT, and inside a nested
iteration that is not decoration: it decides which of the active loops answers. The resolver
names the same ids in `getNames()`.

`TestApplication`, `WorkflowModuleTest` and `ApplicationSmokeTest` are identical in every
blueprint - copy them unchanged.

## Adding this blueprint to an existing project

1. Use a multi-instance SUBPROCESS when a whole section repeats, and a multi-instance TASK
   when one step does. The choice is about the model; the business code is the same either
   way.
2. Put what each level iterates over onto the workflow aggregate, as identifiers, and fill
   both collections in a task BEFORE the subprocess is reached.
3. Give the subprocess its loop characteristics (`camunda:collection="${regionIds}"` on
   Camunda 7, `inputCollection="=regionIds"` on Camunda 8) and the task inside it its own.
4. In a task that belongs to ONE level, name that element in the annotations:
   `@MultiInstanceElement("SubProcess_AssessRegion")`. **A task which is not multi-instance
   itself still runs inside the iteration of the subprocess around it**, and this is how it
   learns which one.
5. In a task sitting in SEVERAL iterations, write a `MultiInstanceElementResolver` bean and
   name it with `@MultiInstanceElement(resolverBean = ...)`. It is handed every active
   context, keyed by element id and ordered outermost first, and returns one object. Asking
   for each value separately works too and gets long fast.
6. Write a row per iteration, never into an attribute the iterations share, and put the
   element of the enclosing iteration into that row - otherwise a result cannot be told
   apart from its siblings later.
7. Put a result over the inner loop into a task at the END of the outer one, and a result
   over the outer loop into a task AFTER the subprocess. An iteration cannot know whether it
   is the last.
8. Extend `LoanApprovalIT` with assertions that do not depend on order.
   `containsExactlyInAnyOrder` rather than `containsExactly`: with two levels there are more
   siblings, and still no order between them.

## Verifying

```bash
mvn install verify
```

That runs on Camunda 7, which is embedded and needs no infrastructure. `-Pcamunda8` needs a
running cluster and `vanillabp.adapters.camunda8.rest-address` configured; do not report a
failure of that profile as a defect of the generated code before having checked it.

`LoanApprovalIT` proves the aspect and has to pass: regions times partners offers, one
summary per region, and the decision over all of them. Run it on both BPMS if you touched
the nesting - the engines report an iteration in completely different ways, and only the
test says whether the values still arrive.

Do not report success without having run this.
